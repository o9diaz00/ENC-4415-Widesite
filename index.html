		<p>This widesite is intended for publication on the media commons platform.  Although this is not necessarily, solely a blog post nor a journal article it comfortably fits into the theme of a "New Everyday", both in title and concept.</p>

		<h1 class="display-4">What is a Widesite?</h1>
		<hr class="my-4">
		<p class = "lead">Who?</p>
		<p>The concept of the mystory and widesite was introduced by Gregory Ulmer</p>
		<p class = "lead">What?</p>
		<p>The Widesite is a method of introspective learning (more or less) --- an approach to learning that differs from the standard curricula and methods of modern academia.  The notion is that one should be able to better grasp (and on a deeper level) what is being taught by first learning of himself.</p>
		<p class = "lead">Why?</p>
		<p>Emergent wicked problems have no easy, or readily-available solution(s).  Furthermore, Ulmer believes that such problems cannot be solved without considering the human element(s) equipped to each problem.  To better solve said conumdrums (or at the very least, distinguish the "good" from the "bad") we must liken ourselves to the issue.  That is, if we accept that human desire to be a primary cause of said wicked problem, then we must see the problem as or within ourselves first before being able to address it proper</p>
		<p class = "lead">How?</p>
		<p>Within Ulmer's <i>Internet Invention</i>, the reader is taken through the process of designing a Mystory and a Widesite.  The creation of a widesite can be separated into two categories: the creation of the mystory, and the integration of a wicked problem into said mystory.  First one explores different discourses (primarily Entertainment, Family, Career, and Community) and find various repeating signifiers or connections amongst the four.  It is important to note that these do not have to make sense at first, for the primary interest lies in patterns.  Once having explored a discovered link in more depth and detail, one is to transform his acquired analysis into an emblem; this is a representation of one's self, his history and method of thought.  Once this emblem is created, it is to be made applicable to a wicked problem</p>
