				<h5>Quadrant 3: Career</h5>
				<p>I <i>almost</i> pursued the career of an art professional.  The ability to create whatever one wants, only limited by his imagination and skill (to some degree) was extremely appealing.  Though this path eluded me, I am fortunate enough to have viewed the life of many within the field before me and acquire an abundance of insight to which I continue to apply to my daily existence.</p>
				<p>Beyond just the artistic ability of creating landscapes, seascapes, moonscapes, cityscapes, and any other scapes one could think of, there is much else to learn.  Take the word s<strong>cape</strong>grace for example --- this refers to a scoundrel, or a rascal.  A word perfectly befitting, in my opinion, one of the world's greatest artists, Jackson Pollock.  For I could not find much art greater than his art of deception; that's right, he was a fantastic con artist.</p>

				<h5>Quadrant 4: Community</h5>
				<p>"I am a New York native so I am aware of the city's notoriety for having such large building architectures, like skyscrapers.  Believe it or not, I can't recall ever being in one, but always looking up their neverending reach, scaling up to the clouds, from the ground floor.  I discovered that skyscrapers also exist in a place in South Africa called Cape Town.  Coincidentally, I also happened to find an article referring bribe attempts within Cape Town."</p>

		<h1 class = "display-4">Emblem</h1>
		<p class = "lead">Across my four quadrants of the pop-cycle, a repeating signifier unveiled was heroism.  Justice, heroism, and words of that nature are not necesarily defined words, in fact, one would mostly have to give an example of these words in order to <i>accurately</i> define them (they are signified rather than signifiers)...</p>
		<hr class = "my-4">
		<p>Having said that, I took my analysis and decided upon an image that could represent such notions and at the same time befit me and my train of thoughts --- such was a cape.  A superhero is, conceptually, the epitome of heroism, and the cape is a distinguishing feature on many popular superheroes.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, as far as we know, superheroes only exist within our fictional media.  The power to create such an entity lies in one's imagination, and what better tool to bring such to life with the grandest of creativity and vigor, than art?  Hence, the paint brush debuting here, but this is not the sole reasoning.</p>
		<p class = "lead">Interpreting Meaning</p>
		<p>As stated prior, a superhero is the epitome of heroism, however, they only exist in our fictitious media, and reality's heroes are the ones whom are succumbing and participating in the wicked problem.  A paint brush emerging as my emblem unifies the existence of a superhero with my relationship with art.  Essentially a superhero(es) is designed to solve any and all problems, with my art, I can create such and in turn, a solution for every problem.  This however will only exist outside the realms of reality, which drives home the second portion of this emblem's meaning.  Some problems just cannot be solved as the desire to keep them, or the <i>privileges</i> that contributes or creates the problematic phenomenon itself, outweighs the desire to rectify said issue.  The only <i>real</i> solutions exist outside the realms of reality; coming to terms with such lets me know that I must cope and coexist with the problem, and should I want to find a resolution, I have to look where the imagination runs rampart and are not bound by any limitations --- this outlet would be my art.</p>
		<p>In a nutshell, how does the paint brush help me combat bribery?  It does not, at least not outwardly.  However, it allows me to create a veil that assists me with maintaining stability whilst this emergent problem exists.  My being, remaining healthy and stable is the first and perhaps most important step and attribute that allows me to even try to plot against this villain</p>
