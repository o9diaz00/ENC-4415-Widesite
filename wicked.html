				<h5>Bribery</h5>
				<p>This is where bribery lives and grows.  It's not only a problem... It's a wicked problem.  Bribery is already prominent and thus befits "emergent" and due to its nature and that of human's and their tendancies for desire, this problem is nigh impossible to solve --- it is a wicked problem.  One of the most protuberant outcomes of bribery (or rather accepted bribery) is corruption, an attribute that is all too common in authorities across the world.</p>

		<p>The wicked problem I chose to consult is the acceptance of bribes in authoritative positions.  This refers to anyone with a bit of power and/or 'prestige' over the common man, such as police officers, government officials, etcetera.  Corruption becomes a prominent result of accepted bribes amongst these positions of power, so often the two are spoken of in tandem as the former seldom exists without the latter (one may even define the act of bribing as the act of corrupting).  In 2019, within the United States, there were 252 <strong>recorded</strong> bribery offenders sentenced under US Sentence Commissioning Guidelines.</p>

						<p class="card-text">Sandoval, the ex Illinois State Senator admits to accepting more than $250,000 in bribes as part of criminal activity that involved more than five participants.  One bribe that he accepted was financial and "other benefits" from an affiliation with a Chicago-area, red-light camera company.  In exchange, Sandoval would block legislation harmful to the red-light camera industry. </p>
						<p>This articles receives the notoriety of being the "featured" one on this page because of the rank of the criminal is more prestigious than that of the ones in the following articles.  If bribery is something that is so ingrained even in the offices of government, this only further exemplifies the difficulty of solving such a problem.</p>

					<p>Three men of Somali origin attempt to bribe an officer to make matters involving a shot and wounded victim "go away".  It was worth including this article as it occurred in "<strong>Cape</strong> Town".  Cape is a repeating signifier in my Mystory.</p>

					<p class="card-text">From Ronald Barthes, we get the concept of "punctum" meaning that which stings emotionally.  Out of all articles scoured, there is nothing particularly special about this one nor personal, it is solely featured for it being memorable.  The irony of an employee whose only job is to uphold the law, being caught breaking it.  And the irony does not end there: the position of police officer is revered by many as a heroic duty; imagine, the reality of the proposed hero, actually being the villain.  The response, as properly rehearsed was, "Itâ€™s rare that a police officer commits a crime...", I think in reality, a more correct statement would be that it's rare a police officer is caught and punished, when committing a crime.  Imagine how many occur frequently but do not see the light of the day, or is unfairly dismissed due to corruption, amongst other factors.</p>
